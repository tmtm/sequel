Issue Guidelines
----------------

1) Issues should only be created for things that are definitely bugs.
   If you are not sure that the behavior is a bug, ask about it on
   IRC or the sequel-talk Google Group.  GitHub Issues should not be
   used as a help forum.

2) If you are sure it is a bug, then post a complete description of
   the issue, the simplest possible self-contained example showing
   the problem, the full backtrace of any exception, and for issues
   involving database queries, an SQL log.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

1) Try to include tests for all new features and substantial bug
   fixes.  See the testing guide for details about testing Sequel.

2) Try to include documentation for all new features.  In most cases
   this should include RDoc method documentation, but updates to the
   guides is also appropriate in some cases.

3) Follow the style conventions of the surrounding code.  In most
   cases, this is standard ruby style.

4) Do not submit whitespace changes with code changes.  Sequel is not
   pedantic about trailing whitespace, so if you have an editor that
   automatically strips trailing whitespace, you may want to turn
   that feature off.
   
5) All code in pull requests is assummed to be MIT licensed.  Do not
   submit a pull request if that isn't the case.
